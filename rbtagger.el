;;; Commentary:

;; RbTagger is an Emacs library based on ctags, ripper-tags, and
;; xref.el.  It indexes your entire Ruby project along with gems and
;; provides smarter than average tag lookup.

  "The syntax chars to find Ruby symbols.
Used as argument to `skip-syntax-forward' and
`skip-syntax-backward'.  w is for word constituents; _ is for
symbol constituents; ' is for expression prefixes.  These chars
work for both `ruby-mode' and `enh-ruby-mode', although the
former considers @ and $ as prefix characters and the latter
doesn't.  There are no use cases for these extra prefix
characters, so we should be safe here.  See Info node `(elisp)
